        /*First step is to break the whole sequence 3,7,33,37,73,77,... into 2 smaller sub-sequences:
        3,33,37,333,337,373,377,... and 7,73,77,733,737,773,777,...  Looking closer at these sub-sequneces
        one see that there is a pattern in them. 3*10 + 3 = 33, 3*10 + 7 = 37, 33*10 + 3 = 333, 33*10 + 7 = 337,
        Same with the other sub-sequence: 7*10 + 3 = 73, 7*10 + 7 = 77, 73*10 + 3 = 733, 73*10 + 7 = 737.
        Lets give the terms in the first subsequence: a_1,a_2,a_3,... where a_1 = 3, a_2 = 33,....
        the following recursion formula exist:
        a_2 = a_1 * 10 + 3     (33)
        a_3 = a_1 * 10 + 7     (37)
        a_4 = a_2 * 10 + 3     (333)
        a_5 = a_2 * 10 + 7     (337)
        more general:
        a_k+1 = a_k * 10 + 3
        a_k+2 = a_k * 10 + 7
        a_k+3 = a_k+1 * 10 + 3
        a_k+4 = a_k+1 * 10 + 7     for k = 1,2,3,...
        The formula is the same for the other sub-sequence too starting with 7,73,77,...
        There is also a sequnece for the whole sequence: 3,7,33,37,73,77,..
        Let a_1 = 3, a_2 = 7, a_3 = 33,....
        a_k+2 = a_k * 10 + a_1
        a_k+3 = a_k * 10 + a_2
        a_k+4 = a_k+1 * 10 + a_1
        a_k+5 = a_k+1 * 10 + a_2
        a_k+6 = a_k+2 * 10 + a_1
        a_k+7 = a_k+2 * 10 + a_2
        Can also be written as
        a_k+2 = a_k * 10 + 3
        a_k+3 = a_k * 10 + 7   and the same way for the other terms too since a_1 = 3, a_2 = 7.
        A general formula for this one: a_2n+1 = a_n * 10 + 3, n = 1,2,3,... for even terms in the sequence and
        a_2n+2 = a_n * 10 + 7, for n = 1,2,3,... for odd terms in the sequence.
        
        In the exercise we have an interval between (a,b). The idea is to first loop through the interval (1,b)
        and find out how many luckynumbers there are in the interval. And then do the same thing for interval(1,a)
        Then substract the amount of luckynumbers in int (1,a) from (1,b) to get the total amount of 
        luckynumbers in interval (a,b)
        I was thinking of doing this with a while-loop. Now the tricky part is getting the recursion formula
        into the while-loop. the program should add 1 (luckyNumbers++;) each time the loop hit a value on the 
        recursion formula. And that way the luckynumbers are counted in an interval.

            List<int> blucNumbers = new List<int>();   // luckynumber list for (1,b)
